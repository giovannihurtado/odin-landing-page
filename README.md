# Project: Tourism Landing Page

## Project Description

This project is a tourism-focused landing page, designed to attract visitors and guide them towards exploring travel destinations and offers. The page is built using semantic HTML5 and is prepared for styling with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## The main goals are to:

Showcase attractive destinations: Display inspiring images and descriptions of places to visit.

Communicate the value proposition: Explain what makes the tourism agency or service unique.

Facilitate contact: Offer clear ways for interested users to get in touch.

### Project Structure

The landing page is organized into key sections for intuitive navigation:

##Header: Contains the agency's logo, the main navigation menu (Home, About, Contact), and an impactful hero section with an eye-catching title, a brief description, and a call-to-action (CTA).

### Main Content:

**Home:** Displays a grid of featured destination cards, each with an image and a concise description.

**About:** Presents information about the agency, its mission, and what sets it apart.

**Contact:** Provides contact details (phone, email) and a button to facilitate communication.

**Footer:** Includes copyright information and important links like privacy policy or terms and conditions (optional).

### Technologies Used
